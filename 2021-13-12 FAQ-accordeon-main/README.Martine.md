## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
24-11 Het is alweer een tijd geleden om de challenge te gaan starten maar ik heb het idee dat ik voldoende snap van JS om te beginnen.
Anders ga ik naar: 
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp
- codeacademy.com
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4XKi25I2M&list=PL_c9BZzLwBRLVh9OdCBYFEql6esA6aRsi

 
de webpagina is een lijstje FAQ met 5 vragen: 
- Bij het klikken van de vraag komt het antwoord van die ene vraag tevoorschijn.
 --> De geopende vraag wordt vet gedrukt. Het antwoord is kleiner.
- Op een andere vraag klikken sluit de geopende vraag en opent de nieuwe 
- met de muis over een vraag gaan wordt de vraag rood en de pointer wordt een handje

De tekst is een <ol> of een ander type? --> verstandig is om te kijken hoe ik met DOM de inhoud kan manipuleren
pseudocode:

DOE vraagnaarrood
ALS onMousehover vraag DAN
	vraag rood
	muis wordt handje

DOE antwoordopvraag
ALS onmouseclick vraag DAN
	ALS ander antwoord is zichtbaar DAN		
		zichtbare vraag vet naar niet vet		
		sluit antwoord 
	geklikte vraag vet
	antwoord geklikte vraag zichtbaar

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
